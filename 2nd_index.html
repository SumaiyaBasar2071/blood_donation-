            We all should be aware of our blood groups. It plays a very
            important role when it comes to having a blood transfusion. Knowing
            our blood group helps us to select appropriate blood for transfusion
            either during any emergencies or accidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            A human blood cell includes red blood cells, white blood cells, and
            platelets. All these blood cells play a significant role in
            transportation, protection and regulation. Blood groups are mainly
            determined by the presence or absence of antigens and antibodies on
            the surface of our red blood cells or erythrocytes. The blood
            transfusion from the wrong blood group can be life-threatening.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four major blood groups are: A, B, AB and O. The blood grouping
            system was discovered in the year 1901 by Karl Landsteiner- an
            Austrian biologist and immunologist.

            </dt>
            <dd style="font-weight: 450; color: black; font-size: 17px">
              - Safe blood saves lives. Blood is needed by women with
              complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with
              severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition,
              accident victims and surgical and cancer patients. There is a
              constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be
              stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood
              donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to
              ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever
              it is needed. Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give
              to another person, the gift of life. A decision to donate your
              blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated
              into its components : red cells, platelets and plasma which can be
              used individually for patients with specific conditions.

              2.What happens when I give blood?
            </dt>
            <dd style="font-weight: 450; color: black; font-size: 17px">
              - Whether you are a first-time or regular donor, the blood service
              must make sure that you will come to no harm by donating blood.
              This includes checking your blood to be sure it will be safe for
              the person who receives it. Before you give blood, you will be
              asked questions about your medical history, including any
              medication you are taking, and about your current health and
              lifestyle. You may also be asked about recent travel; for example,
              if you live in a country where there is no malaria, you may be
              asked whether you have recently visited a tropical country. These
              questions will be asked only to safeguard your own health and the
              health of the person receiving your blood. You will be told
              whether you are eligible to give blood and, if not, whether you
              may be able to donate blood in the future. Any personal
              information that you give will be kept confidential and will not
              be used for any other purpose. It is very important to be truthful
              about any reasons why your blood might not be suitable. Although
              blood is always tested for infections that can be transmitted by
              transfusion, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis, a test
              may not be able to detect a very recent infection. This means that
              even though the blood may test negative for a particular
              infection, it might still infect a patient receiving a blood
              transfusion. After answering the questions you will also be given
              a brief medical examination that may include checking your pulse
              and blood pressure and ensuring that your weight meets a certain
              minimum. A drop of blood will then be taken from your fingertip to
              check that giving blood will not make you anaemic. Your health is
              very important to the blood transfusion service and blood will not
              be taken unless you can safely give a donation that day. Donating
              blood is very simple. You will be made as comfortable as possible,
              usually in a special chair or on a bed. The area inside one of
              your elbows will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution before a
              trained health worker inserts a sterile needle, connected to a
              blood collection bag, into your vein. It usually takes about 10
              minutes to donate blood. After resting for 10 or 15 minutes and
              taking some refreshment, you will be able to return to your normal
              activities, although you should avoid strenuous activity for the
              rest of the day. You should drink plenty of fluids over the next
              24 hours.

            <dd style="font-weight: 450; color: black; font-size: 17px">
              - In most countries, the volume of blood taken is 450 millilitres,
              less than 10 per cent of your total blood volume (the average
              adult has 4.5 to 5 litres of blood). In some countries, a smaller
              volume is taken. Your body will replace the lost fluid within
              about 36 hours.

            <dd style="font-weight: 450; color: black; font-size: 17px">
              - Yes. Remember that you will only be accepted as a blood donor if
              you are fit and well. Your health and well-being are very
              important to the blood service. The needle and blood bag used to
              collect blood come in a sterile pack that cannot be reused, so the
              process is made as safe as possible.

              - Just squeeze the inside of your elbow tightly and you will get a
              quick idea of what the needle feels like. All you should feel is a
              gentle pressure and a momentary “pinprick” sensation. Blood
              donation is very safe and discomfort or problem during or after
              donating is very uncommon.

              - The criteria for donor selection varies from country to country,
              but blood can be donated by most people who are healthy and do not
              have an infection that can be transmitted through their blood. The
              age at which people are eligible to give blood varies, but is
              commonly between the ages of 17 and 65. Some countries accept
              donations from people from the age of 16 and extend the upper age
              limit beyond 65 years. Healthy adults can give blood regularly –
              at least twice a year. Your local blood service can tell you how
              frequently you can give blood.

            </dt>
            <dd style="font-weight: 450; color: black; font-size: 17px">
              - The blood service is concerned with the welfare of both the
              blood donor and the recipient (patient). Donors are often asked
              not to donate blood for a period of time in the interests of their
              safety and/or that of the blood supply. You should not give blood
              if your own health might suffer as a result. The first concern of
              the blood service is to ensure that blood donation does no harm to
              the blood donor. You should not donate blood if:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>You are feeling unwell</li>
                <li>You are anaemic</li>
                <li>
                  You are pregnant, have been pregnant within the last year or
                  are breastfeeding
                </li>
                <li>
                  You have certain medical conditions, which might make you an
                  unsuitable donor
                </li>
                <li>
                  You are taking certain medications, such as antibiotics.
                </li>
              </ul>
              You may be able to donate blood at a later time. In some cases,
              however, in order to protect your own health you will not be able
              to donate blood. You should not donate blood if it might cause
              harm to the patient who receives it. Blood can transmit
              life-threatening infections to patients who receive blood
              transfusions. You should not donate blood if:<br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You have or may recently have contracted a sexually
                  transmitted disease, such as HIV or syphilis, that can be

                </li>
                <li>
                  Your lifestyle puts you at risk of contracting an infection
                  that can be transmitted through your blood: for example, if
                  you have more than one sexual partner or have sexual contact
                  with prostitutes
                </li>

                  You have recently had a tattoo, skin scarification or ear or
                  body piercing – your local blood service can tell you how long
                  you must wait before giving blood

            <dd style="font-weight: 450; color: black; font-size: 17px">
              - Consistent with current general global practice, recipients of
              SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that do not contain live virus may donate
              blood if they feel well. As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been
              developed only recently, in settings where deferrals would not
              compromise blood supply availability, the National Blood
              Transfusion Service may consider implementing a precautionary
              deferral period of up to seven days to minimize the impact of
              call-backs from donors who develop symptoms subsequent to donating
              soon after vaccination. Recipients of live virus vaccines (e.g.,

              deferred for four weeks, consistent with current practices.
              Persons who feel unwell after receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
              should be deferred for seven days after complete resolution of
              symptoms, or as specified after receipt of a virus vector-based or
              live-attenuated vaccine, whichever is the longer period. In
              situations where it cannot be established whether the donor
              received a live virus vaccine, a four-week deferral period should
              be applied. For more detailed information, please refer to:
